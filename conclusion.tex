\section{Conclusion}
Inter-DC multicast is critical to the performance of
global-scale online service providers, but
prior efforts that focus
on optimizing WAN performance are insufficient.
This paper presents \name,
an application-level multicast overlay network that substantially
improves the performance of
inter-DC bulk-data multicast.
%This paper presents \name, which
\name demonstrates the feasibility
and practical benefits of a fully centralized multicast overlay
network that selects overlay paths and schedules data transfers
in a near-optimal, yet efficient manner.
The key insight underlying \name's centralized design is
that there are significant benefits achieved by making slightly delayed
decisions based on a global view and that this outweighs the cost of
centralization. %, such as gathering information to the controller.
We believe that the insight of decoupling scheduling and routing, to
speed up the execution of a centralized algorithm
%informs our design choice
can be generalized to inspire other centralized control platforms
%in other settings
where centralized decision-making strikes
a favorable balance between costs and benefits.
