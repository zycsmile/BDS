\section{Conclusion}
Inter-DC multicast is critical to the performance of
global-scale online service providers, but
prior efforts that focus
on optimizing WAN performance are insufficient.
This paper presents \name,
an application-level multicast overlay network that substantially
improves the performance of
bulk-data inter-DC multicast.
%This paper presents \name, which
\name demonstrates the feasibility
and practical benefits of a fully centralized multicast overlay
network that selects overlay paths and schedules data transfers
in a near-optimal yet efficient manner.
The key insight underlying \name's centralized design is
the benefits of making slightly delayed
decisions based on a global view outweigh the cost of
centralization.%, such as gathering information to the controller.
We believe the insight of decoupling scheduling and routing to reduce computational overhead and to speed up the execution of centralized algorithm
%informs our design choice
can be generalized to inspire other centralized control platforms
%in other settings 
where centralized decision-making strikes
a favorable balance between costs and benefits.
