\section{Conclusion}
Inter-DC multicast is critical to the performance of
global-scale online service providers, but
prior efforts that focus
on optimizing WAN performance are insufficient.
This paper presents \name, an application-level multicast overlay network with dynamic bandwidth separation that substantially improves the performance of inter-DC bulk-data multicast, \NEW{and its enhanced version \newname, with dynamic bandwidth separation between online latency-sensitive traffic and offline bulk-data transfer.
While \name demonstrates the feasibility
and practical benefits of a fully centralized multicast overlay
network that selects overlay paths and schedules data transfers
in a near-optimal yet efficient manner, \newname shows further improvements by dynamically separating online and offline traffic instead of a fixed boundary.
The key insight underlying \newname's dynamic bandwidth separation design is that there is still much available bandwidth for bulk-data transfer by making use of residual bandwidth based on online traffic usage prediction.
%that there are significant benefits achieved by making slightly delayed
%decisions based on a global view and that this outweighs the cost of
%centralization. %, such as gathering information to the controller.
We believe that the insight of multicast overlay network in \name, to speed up the execution of a centralized algorithm, together with the inspiration of dynamic bandwidth prediction in \newname,
%informs our design choice
can be generalized to other control platforms
%in other settings
where the decision-making logic strikes
a favorable balance between insurance and efficiency.
