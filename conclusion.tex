\section{Conclusion}
Bulk-data multicast is critical and challenging to global-scale
online service providers. 
We argue that the prior work focusing on optimizing WAN performance
is incomplete, and that an intelligent application-level multicast 
overlay network is needed.
This paper presents \name, which demonstrates the feasibility 
and practical benefits of a fully centralized multicast overlay 
network that selects overlay paths and schedules data transfer in
a near-optimal yet efficient manner.
The key insight underlying \name's centralized design is that the 
benefits of decision-making informed by a global view
outweigh its cost, such as coarse-grained updates.
We believe our insight that informs our centralized design can be 
generalized to inspire centralized control platforms in other 
settings where centralized decision-making trikes a favorable 
balance between costs and benefits.
