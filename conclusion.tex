\section{Conclusion}
Inter-DC multicast is critical to global-scale online service 
providers.
We argue that prior work that focuses on optimizing WAN performance
is insufficient, and this paper presents \name, 
an application-level multicast overlay network that substantially
improve bulk-data inter-DC multicast performance.
%This paper presents \name, which 
\name demonstrates the feasibility
and practical benefits of a fully centralized multicast overlay
network that selects overlay paths and schedules data transfer in
a near-optimal yet efficient manner.
The key insight underlying \name's centralized design is that the
benefits of making decisions based on a global view
outweigh the cost of centralization, such as gathering information
to the controller.
We believe our insight that informs our design choice can be
generalized to inspire centralized control platforms in other
settings where centralized decision-making could strike a favorable
balance between costs and benefits.
