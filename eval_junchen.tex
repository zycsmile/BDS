\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate \name, we integrated our end-to-end prototype in \company, and ran a pilot deployment across the above network to serve 70 TB data per day per hour  over a period of 7 days.
The evaluation results of the pilot deployment, together with trace-driven simulation and microbenchmarks, show that:
\begin{packedenumerate}
\item \name completes bulk-data multicast 3-5$\times$ faster than \company's existing solution, as well as other industry-standard solutions (\Section\ref{subsec:evaluation:centralized}).
\item \name eliminates interference with latency-sensitive data using a clean bandwidth separation, while having only negligible impact on link utilization (\Section\ref{subsec:evaluation:benchmarks})
\item \name can update decisions every 3 seconds over a WAN of the same size as B4, is lightweight in terms of CPU, bandwidth consumed (\Section\ref{subsec:evaluation:benchmarks}).
\end{packedenumerate}

\subsection{Benefits of centralized control}
\label{subsec:evaluation:centralized}

We compare \name's against three baselines in terms of
multicast completion time:
\company's existing solution (a decentralized strategy),
Bullet~\cite{??} (a centralized strategy), and
Akamai's overlay network~\cite{??} for live video streaming
multicast.

\jc{briefly explain how two schemes are compared
side by side in the pilot deployment}

\mypara{Trace-driven simulation}
\jc{how trace-driven simulation is done.}

%To evaluate the benefits of centralized control, we conduct two series of experiments: the comparisons with \company's existing solution based on the pilot deployments, and the comparisons with other overlay multicast techniques using trace-driven simulations.

\tightsubsubsection{\name vs. \company's existing solution}

We measure \name's performance versus \company's existing solution that has already run for more than 5 years. In this series of experiments, we choose a 70~TB data file that is distributed stored in the source DC (with 1000 servers) at the very beginning, and each of the other DCs announces a downloading requirement and stores the file in the same way with 1000 servers.

%First of all, we present the completion time of destination servers under \name and \company in Figure

To intuitively present the overall improvements by \name, we draw the CDF of the completion time in Figure \ref{fig:BDSvsAnon:overall}, from which we can see that the completion time under \company's existing solution is about 200 minutes while that of \name is less than 40 minutes, 5 times shorter completion time.

For detailed illustration, we pick three applications whose data volumes are large, medium and small, and draw a bar chart of three pairs of bars in Figure \ref{fig:BDSvsAnon:FCT}, each representing \name's and \company's mean (stddev) completion time for one application. These bars show that for small data volume, \name outperforms 1.6$\times$ than \company, but raises up to more than 3$\times$ than \company for large data volume. In other words, the benefit of \name will increase along with the data volumes.

To prove that this is not a special case, we repeat the experiments during the 7 days, and draw the average completion time of both \name and \company in Figure \ref{fig:BDSvsAnon:time}. \name is quite stable during the 7 days while \company illustrates some volatilities. But in general, \name achieves about 4.5$\times$ shorter completion time than \company.

%\item By applications: Pick three applications whose data volumes are large, medium, and small respectively. Draw a bar chart of three pairs of bars, each representing \name's and \company's mean (stddev) flow completion time for an application.

%\end{itemize}

\tightsubsubsection{\name vs. other overlay multicast techniques}

As we cannot implement other experimental systems in our real online network just as comparisons, we conduct a series of simulations using trace-driven simulations in this section, and compare \name's performance versus Bullet \cite{kostic2003bullet} and a CDN-based solution \cite{Andreev2013Designing} adopted by Akamai.

We use the same topology with 12 DCs (1 DC acts as the source DC), 1000 servers per DC for all simulations, and set the parameters all the same as the real network, including data file size $\mathbb{S}$, set of source and destination pairs $S=(s,d_i),1\leq i \leq 11$, path $p_\lambda$, link capacities $c(l_{u,v})$ and server upload/download rate $R_{up}(n)/R_{down}(n)$.

Bullet \cite{kostic2003bullet} is a distributed algorithm that works on an overlay mesh network, it enables geo-spread nodes to self-organize into a overlay mesh. Specifically, each node uses RanSub \cite{Rodriguez2003Using} to distribute summary tickets information to other nodes, and receives disjoint data from his sending peers. The most obvious difference between \name and Bullet lies in the control scheme, i.e., \name is centralized method, who can maximize total system traffic, while Bullet is a decentralized scheme and each node makes decision according to his obtained information. We conduct three series of experiments and show the results in Figure \ref{fig:versusCDN}: baseline \ref{fig:cdn:baseline}, large scale \ref{fig:cdn:scale} and small bandwidth experiments \ref{fig:cdn:bw}. We find \name achieves 3$\times$ shorter completion time than Bullet in the baseline experiments, and more than 4$\times$ improvement in the large scale experiments and small bandwidth experiments.


Akamai design a 3-layer overlay network for delivering live streams \cite{Andreev2013Designing}, where a source forwards its streams to reflectors, and a reflector sends outgoing streams to the final stage sinks. Things \name and Akamai have in common is that both of them are designed for data distribution on overlay multicast networks. There are two main differences  between Akamai and \name: (1) Akamai adopts a 3-layer topology where an edgeserver receives data from the parent reflectors, while \name could explore more potential searching space without layer limitation. (2) A sink in Akamai receives must receive data in sequential order because it serves for the live streaming application, but \name does care about blocks arriving order. Thus, to achieve optimal scheduling results, \name should also solve the scheduling problem so as to work out the optimal block download order $\overrightarrow{o}(s_i)$. The comparison results of Akamai and \name are shown in Table \ref{table:versusAkamai}, which shows that \name achieves 4-8$\times$ speedup over Akamai's layered solution.

\end{figure}
%\vspace{-0.4cm}

To test the effectiveness of bandwidth separation and check whether the bulk data transfer will reserve bandwidth for latency-sensitive traffic according to the separation quota, we set the upper bound of available bandwidth for bulk data transfer to 10~Gbps, and then monitor the real usage of one inter-DC link. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:quota}, from which we can see the real bandwidth usage stays below the upper bound (10~Gbps) throughout the whole transmission process, verifying that the separation does take effects on link bandwidth usage and thus can reduce the incidents of delay on latency-sensitive traffic caused by bulk data transfers.

As \name implements strict bandwidth separation between latency-sensitive traffic and bulk data transfer while still showing shorter completion time, does \name increase link utilization significantly? To answer this question, we record the average utilizations of: (1) the egress link of the source DC, and (2) 3 randomly selected inter-DC links, denoted as $l_1,l_2$ and $l_3$. Results are shown in Table \ref{table:usage}, which shows that link utilizations do not change much with \name or with \company. This is because \name can make disjoint data transfers to different receivers and thus avoids transferring repeated data compared the self-organized \company's solution.

\subsection{Micro-benchmarks}
\label{subsec:evaluation:benchmarks}

This section focuses on some benchmarks of \name. On one hand, as \name adopts centralized control, the running time of controller and the scalability of the algorithm are key concerns. On the other hand, \name applies two approximations on the origin problem, and the resulting benefits and tradeoffs need to be clarified.

\tightsubsubsection{Scalability of centralized control.}

\mypara{Controller Running Time} As the controller needs to select optimal $s_{B_{i,j}}^*$, $p_{B_{i,j}}^*$ and assign $f^*_{B_{i,j},p_{B_{i,j}}^*}$ for all blocks $B_{i,j}$, the algorithm running time is thus related to the number of blocks. We show the relationship in Figure \ref{fig:scale:cpu}, from which we can see that even when there are $3\times 10^5$ blocks, the controller running time is still lower than $300ms$. Further, the block merging and non-blocking update schemes described in \Section\ref{subsec:system:centralized} also help to mask the algorithm running time.

\mypara{Network delay} \name works in inter-DC networks, so the network delay among DCs is another key factor that can not be ignored in the algorithm updating process. We add timestamps on particular requests, calculate network latency and present the results of 5000 requests in Figure \ref{fig:scale:network}, from which we can see that most of the delay is below $40ms$ and the average latency is about 27 $ms$, which is less than 1\% of the decision updating cycle (3 seconds).

\mypara{Feedback loop delay} The feedback loop delay of centralized algorithms is essential to the algorithm scalability. In \name, this loop delay consists of several processes: controller collects update information from agents, runs the centralized algorithm, and then updates control messages to local agents. We measure the delay of the whole process, show the CDF in Figure \ref{fig:scale:feedback}, and find that in most cases (over 80\%), the feedback loop delay is lower than $200ms$. So we can claim that \name demonstrates a short enough update delay and thus enjoys good scalability to even larger systems.

\tightsubsubsection{In-depth analysis.}

\mypara{Impact of block sizes} In \name, the bulk data file is split into blocks so that can be transferred from multiple sources on disjoint paths. But this introduces a tradeoff caused by different block sizes. We therefore conduct two series of experiments using different block sizes (2M and 64M). Figure \ref{fig:analysis:blksize} shows that the completion time in the 2M/block scenario is 1.5-2$\times$ shorter than that in the 64M/block scenario. This is because smaller block size leads to less degeneration on the theoretical optimum (see Appendix 2 for the proof). However, this optimization introduces longer controller running time, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:scale:cpu}, there will be 32$\times$ more blocks in 2M/block scenario. Overall, block size decisions depend on: (1) requirements on the completion time, and (2) controller's running time.

\mypara{Breakdown of feedback loop delay} \name also applies the approximation of separating data scheduling from overlay routing, which can also reduce algorithm running time. We show the measurements on algorithm running time in Figure \ref{fig:analysis:time}. At the very beginning, the running time is nearly $800ms$, but drops to $300ms$ and even less quickly. This is because the separated scheduling stage selects only a subset of blocks, making the number of blocks decrease significantly and simplifying the routing decision making process.

\mypara{Availability of disjoint overlay paths} \Section\ref{subsec:motivation:case-for} reveals the observation that the benefits of application-level overlay networks depend critically on if there exist disjoint paths between two nodes. To explore the potential benefit, we record the ratio of the number of blocks downloaded from the original source to the total number of blocks, and the CDF is shown in Figure \ref{fig:analysis:overlay}. For about 90\% servers, the proportion of blocks downloaded from the original source is less than 20\%, which means that more than 80\% blocks are downloaded from other DCs on the disjoint paths, demonstrating great potential of multicast overlay network.

In summary, both the prototype pilot deployed on \company network and the trace-driven simulations of \name achieve 3-5$\times$ speedup over existing solutions, with good scalability, fast algorithm convergence and lightweight resource consumption.
