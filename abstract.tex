Many important cloud services require replicating massive data from
one datacenter (DC) to multiple DCs. While the performance of pair-wise
inter-DC data transfers has been much improved, prior solutions
are insufficient to optimize bulk-data multicast, as they fail to
explore the capability of servers to store-and-forward data, as well as
the rich inter-DC overlay paths that exist in geo-distributed DCs.
To take advantage of these opportunities, we present {\em \name}, an
application-level multicast overlay network for large-scale inter-DC data replication. At the core of \name is a {\em fully centralized}
architecture, allowing a central controller to maintain an up-to-date
global view of data delivery status of intermediate servers, in
order to fully utilize the available overlay paths. 
\NEW{To speeds up the computation of the control algorithm, \name decouples the origin algorithm into selection of overlay paths and scheduling of data transfers, each can be optimized efficiently. This enables \name to update overlay routing decisions at the scale of multicasting hundreds of TB data over tens of thousands of overlay paths. Further, to enable \name can be mix-deployed/implemented together with online services in the dynamic network with workload churns, we present an enhanced version called \newname that can realize dynamic bandwidth separation by predicting online traffic and then adjust bandwidth allocation accordingly.
}
A pilot deployment in one of the largest online service providers shows that \name can
achieve 3-5$\times$ speedup over the provider's existing system and
several well-known overlay routing baselines \NEW{ while \newname can further reduce the completion time by up to XXX times by dynamically sharing the residual bandwidth}.
