A common communication pattern in the inter-DC traffic of large 
online service providers is to replicate bulk data from one DC to 
multiple DCs. 
While recent work has shown promising improvement on WAN 
performance, this is necessarily incomplete, as they fall short 
of exploring the abundant disjoint via servers in different DCs,
as well as servers' capability to store-and-forward data.
%Inspired by the early success of multicast overlay networks, 
We argue that an application-level multicast overlay network 
is needed to deliver data via dynamically picked 
overlay servers to fully exploit overlay paths.
However, introducing multicast overlays to the context of inter-DC
communication poses new challenges:
(1) the sheer number of servers and overlay paths renders
it untenable to make optimal overlay selections based on 
data delivery status at all servers in real-time, and
(2) it is vital to avoid any delay of latency-sensitive traffic 
caused by multicasting bulk data, as all traffic share the network 
resource. 
We present {\em \name}, a near-optimal multicast overlay network 
for bulk data multicast. 
\name is centered around two design choices:
(a) fully centralized decision-making, and 
(b) a clean, dynamic separation of bandwidth.
While both design choices introduce costs on performance 
(\name is unable to update decisions in real time or achieve full
link utilization), we believe these costs are outweighed by the 
benefits, such as centralized optimization driven by a global view.
A pilot deployment of \name in one of the largest online
service providers shows that \name achieves 3-5$\times$
speedup over the provider's existing systems.


%Distributing bulk data across datacenters (DCs) in a timely and
%cost-effective manner is critical to large-scale online service
%providers.
%While recent research has significantly improved the WAN performance
%between DCs, we argue that a multicast overlay network that optimally
%schedules and delivers data in a way that fully exploits available
%overlay paths is essential to achieving desirable performance.
%Drawing on the experience of a large online service providers, we
%observe two requirements of an inter-DC multicast overlay network:
%(1) overlay routing and scheduling needs to be driven by an
%up-to-date global view of data delivery status at all servers, and
%(2) it must prevent delay of latency-sensitive
%traffic caused by bulk data transfers.
%
%This paper presents \name, a near-optimal inter-DC multicast overlay
%network that distributing bulk data.
%At the core of \name are two design choices.
%First, decision making in \name is fully centralized; the \name
%controller directly orchestrates servers to split, reorder, and
%deliver data dynamically along overlay paths, in order to
%circumvent inter-/intra-DC bottlenecks.
%Second, \name enforces a dynamic separation of bandwidth allocated
%for bulk data transfers and latency-sensitive traffic.
%While both design choices introduce costs in performance (i.e.,
%\name is unable to update decisions in real time or achieve full
%link utilization), our design philosophy is that these costs are
%outweighed by the benefits of centralized optimization driven
%by a global view.
%Using a pilot deployment of \name in one of the largest search
%engine service providers, we show that \name achieves 3-5$\times$
%speedup over the provider's existing systems and the techniques
%widely used in today's content delivery networks.


%Drawing on lessons from the decade-long evolution of similar systems in Baidu,
%\name take a centralized approach, which uses a controller to maintains the
%data delivery status in all servers, and update the scheduling and overlay routing
%decisions in near real time by solving a multicommodity flow problem using a
%near-optimal yet efficient algorithm.
%The key insight underlying \name's centralized architecture is the observation that
%the cost of not being able to adapt to network conditions in real time (such as in
%a decentralized system) is greatly outweighed by the benefits of centralized
%control to optimally update overlay routing and scheduling even at a coarse
%timescale (every few seconds), as well as the resulting system that has less
%complexity.
