We have deployed \name on \company's DCs, which consist of 67 geo-distributed servers in 10 DCs. Evaluations in the next section are based on this deployment. %The topology is shown as Fig. \ref{fig:topology}.

\name is implemented with 3621 lines of golang code \cite{golang}, and it can be fully integrated in \company's DCs. The three duplications of the controller are implemented on three different geo-located servers.
The data plane (bulk data transmissions) between controller and agents adopts TCP, and the control plane (decision messages) adopts HTTP. For specific transmissions, \name uses \texttt{wget} to make data transfer and sets particular \texttt{--limit-rate} to enforce bandwidth.
%\jc{add linux tc stuff here}
The agent running in each server uses Linux Traffic Control (\texttt{tc}) to enforce the limit on the total bandwidth usage of inter-DC multicast traffic.
%Thus, \name achieves the bandwidth separation dynamically and in real-time.

%\jc{explain the application-facing api}

 %\jc{which option?}

The application-facing API is also very simple because \name's implementation makes no specific requirements on applications. Any application prepares to distribute bulk data just call the public functions provided by \name and follow three steps: first, register on \name, initiate the basic information about source DC, destination DCs, all end servers and the bulk data; second, install agents on the involved end servers; third, assign the start time of bulk data transmission. Then \name will start the data distribution at the specified time. Such simple implementation also makes \name applicable to other companies' DCs. 	

%\jc{this is oversimplistic. did you make any assumption about the agent? what if a hadoop application wants to use your stuff?}

%\jc{a missing piece is what's application interface. if an application wants to send a file, does it make a function call to your system?}

%\jc{what changes did you make on each server? where was the controller implemented? what's the protocol? how did data transfer happen (wget?)? how was bandwidth enforcement done (wget option)? }
