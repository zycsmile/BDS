\section{Overlay Network for Inter-DC Multicast}

\jc{Starting from Section 2, it would be paper outline. 
Please think each bullet point as a separate paragraph.}

We begin by motivating the need for an inter-DC multicast network, and lessons from operating \company's inter-DC multicast network.

\subsection{The need for inter-DC multicast}

\begin{itemize}

\item The architecture of \company's inter-DC WAN. Scale of data centers, data volume, and traffic types

\item A substantial fraction of objects need to be multicast. Its share is rising

\item There are many overlay paths between two DCs. A substantial fraction of them are not bottlenecked by the inter-DC WAN (this is necessary to justify the use of server-level overlay paths, not just DC-level)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\company's inter-DC multicast network}
\begin{itemize}

\item Explain how to multicast data from one DC to many DCs through overlay paths across \company's DCs: e.g., data transfer over HTTP?, How to get the public address of a server in another DC? 

\item Describe the basic idea of \company's protocol (describe it as a receiver-driven decentralized protocol)
We should also stress that this solution has been running for \fillme years and has been continuously improved over time.

\item Briefly mention other solutions (layered structure, hybrid approach, and why not optimizing pair-wise DC link is not sufficient)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lessons from \company's inter-DC multicast network}
\begin{itemize}

\item Lesson 1: need for a global view. Without global view, there is a significant room for improvement. Ideally, we need to show a CDF with two lines that one for flow completion time under the optimal overlay decisions, and other showing the completion time of the existing protocol. 

\item Lesson 2: need for clean traffic separation. (1) Use a figure to show that bulk data transfer can cause significant delay on latency-sensitive traffic, and (2) put some concrete numbers to show such delay can cause significant revenue loss.

\end{itemize}
